== Frequently Asked Questions ==

More info at [plugin homepage](http://www.eventualo.net/blog/?p=400).

= Which WP's database tables can I export in Excel? =

For the moment only these ones: posts (with/without meta), users (with/without meta), links, comments. Other tables in future releases.

= Why did you make this plugin when we can use tools like phpMyAdmin? =

Because some customers are not so familiar with phpMyAdmin, queries... and they prefer using an easy tool in backend.

= Why did I get an error message? =

Maybe you have to set up the exportation's target directory. The default target directory works for *nix systems, but not for Windows ones. So, go to `Settings > Alo Export Xls`, read the security disclaimer and choose a right path.

= When the next release with the X feature? =

Due to more relevant commitments this plugin will not be further developed.
